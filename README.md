# The Covernet

An initiative to build a private, physical, and wireless radio network for [S.V. Cover members](https://www.svcover.nl/show.php?view=read&id=183).

We want to make a range of interesting services (websites, chat, forums, whatever really) available to Cover members not only for the cool-and-nerd factor of experimenting, but also because it has educative value. The project touches on a range of academic fields, including Graph Theory (how can nodes relay information efficiently?), multi-agent systems (how can nodes trust and cooperate with each other?) and of course programming and computer science. 

NOTE I: The code quality is total garbage. This repository is considered experimental.

NOTE II: As it stands, we use [Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org/) [LORA modules](https://www.tinytronics.nl/shop/en/development-boards/microcontroller-boards/with-wi-fi/lilygo-ttgo-t3-lora32-868mhz-v2.1.6-esp32).
